Title:

**Hbridge (Half-Bridge)**

**Use Case:**

Using an off the shelf Hbridge is a quick way to get a reliable Hbridge controller.

The SN754410 (Dual Hbridge IC) is probably the most popular package because  it can handle up to 1 Amp supply current. These will start to get pretty hot, so if you plan on pushing through a lot of current use a heatsink.


**Key Parts:**

SN754410



**quick tip:**

If you keep blowing out your ICs you can build a 3D IC that doubles the current it can handle: (This probably shouldnt be in the &quot;good technique&quot; folder.)
